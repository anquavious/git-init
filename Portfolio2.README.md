## Description

I created my portolio to showcase a sample of my programming skills and work for potential employers to view. The portfolio contains my photo and a brief about me section to show employees my passions, skillset, and the projects I have accomplished and will be accomplishing in the future. This project has learned me how to add structured content on a website using code and how to use media queries to make it function, for desktop, iphone, and tablet. I also learned how to add a submission forms.
